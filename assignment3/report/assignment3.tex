The classification accuracies on the training and validation datasets are as follows:
\input{1A_MLFFNN}

\noi
In addition, the parameter combination were sorted based on minimum fitting time (least fitting time - first) and the model that gave the best accuracy the fastest was chosen. Hence the best parameter combination chosen is:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item hidden\_layer\_sizes: 5
    \item activation: tanh
    \item solver: lbfgs
    \item batch\_size: 200
    \item alpha: 0.0001
    \item learning\_rate: adaptive
\end{itemize}

\noi
The classification accuracy of the best model on the testing data is: $100\%$. The confusion matrices obtained are as follows:
